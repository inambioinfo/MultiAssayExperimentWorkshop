# Multi-omics data representation and analysis with MultiAssayExperiment

Marcel Ramos, Vince Carey, and Levi Waldron

The MultiAssayExperiment software package provides for the coordinated representation of, storage of, and operation on multiple diverse genomics data. It integrates an open-ended set of single-assay data classes, while abstracting the complexity of back-end data objects through a sufficient set of data manipulation, extraction, and re-shaping methods to interface with most R/Bioconductor data analysis and visualization tools. This workshop will introduce the data class and essential operations on it, then will lead users through a complete workflow including construction and several statistical analyses of a multi-omics dataset.

Here are the [slides](https://github.com/waldronlab/presentations/blob/master/Waldron_2017-07-28_Bioc2017-MultiAssayExperimentWorkshop.pptx?raw=true) presented at the start of this workshop.
